## ðŸ‘‹ *Salve!*

Hey there! Yes, my GitHub profile is written in Latin â€” not to be pretentious (hopefully!), but because Iâ€™ve always had a deep interest in the history of the Roman Empire (minus, you know, the whole cruelty and gladiators thing). My real name is **Mauro**, though, and Iâ€™m based in Europe â€” usually somewhere between Slovenia, Italy, Portugal, and the UK.

### A Bit About Me

Iâ€™ve been into coding since the early â€™90s â€” I started in 1991 on a Commodore 64. Thatâ€™s right â€” I'm older than Google.

I got into email pretty early too. In 1993, I was running a BBS that connected to Fidonet and fetched email using UUCP. In 1997, I wrote a webmail client in C that ended up being used by quite a few large companies. A few years later, I built a full mail server to go with it â€” supporting IMAP, POP3, and SMTP.

Fast-forward a couple of decades and, despite all the progress in tech, email infrastructure still felt stuck in the past. Most servers were bloated, overly complex, and hard to maintain. So I decided to build something better â€” a modern, efficient mail and collaboration server from the ground up, written in Rust.

That project became [Stalwart Mail & Collaboration Server](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/stalwart/), the core of what I now work on at [Stalwart Labs](https://github.com/stalwartlabs).

### Other Interests

Outside of software, Iâ€™m into psychology and philosophy. Iâ€™ve got a BSc in Psychology and an MSc in Cognitive and Decision Sciences from UCL. A while back, I even published a paper on the *Effectiveness of an Empathic Chatbot in Combating Adverse Effects of Social Exclusion on Mood* â€” before ChatGPT was cool.

### On the Bike

When Iâ€™m not writing code, Iâ€™m probably out cycling. Iâ€™ve got a modest climbing engine with an FTP around 200W, and I love grinding my way up a good mountain road.
